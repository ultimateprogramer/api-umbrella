# Documenting gem security issues reported by bundler-audit that are tricky to
# upgrade, but we've manually verified we're not vulnerable to.
#
# Support for this .bundlerauditignore when using bundle-audit currently
# requires this patch: https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit/pull/122

# devise: Not relevant since we're not using Remember Me cookies.
CVE-2015-8314

# handlebars: We're not vulnerable since we don't have any unquoted variables
# (eg, attr={{val}} instead of attr="{{value}}"). But it would still be good to
# address, which we'll do whenever we upgrade to a newer version of Ember
# (https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/tree/admin-upgrade).
OSVDB-131671

# mail: Can't upgrade due to Rails 3.2, but our lib/mail_sanitizer.rb addresses
# the underlying issue by raising errors for problematic addresses.
